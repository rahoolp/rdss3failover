Since our RDS MySQL is configured to be multi-AZ, in case of a single AZ outage, data is getting synchronously replicated to another AZ instance and hence odds of data loss are extremely small, hence RPO can be 0.  RTO can also be very minimal around two minute at most for RDS endpoint to automatically failover/point to another AZ instance and per AWS documentation. 

But from primary region outage standpoint we have to be mindful of the fact that data is asynchronously synched to standby region and also the fact that itâ€™s a read replica. We need to account for an alert to notify our support staff and support team to be able to react to the outage and take steps to promote the secondary to become primary and point our applications to the new primary. Given all this our RTO can be 10 minutes and RPO is 0 since data is not lost due to in-place replication.
